The problem statement doesnt fit properly into NEP-171 examples. Also doesnt fit the nft-series repo
https://github.com/near-examples/nft-series.
If we follow the NEP-171 standard, it will cause lots of gas errros and high storage costs.
So had to implement something different and still make it compatible with NEP-171.

Since a album has many album bundles, and a album bundle will have many songs. It is a many to many relationship.
So what I did was simulate a many to many relationship. If you can check the diagrams folder you will know better. You need to install draw.io Visual Studio Code Extension for that.
